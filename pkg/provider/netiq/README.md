# MFA

2 MFA options are supported: Auto and Privileged

# Auto
This is the default MFA option of NetIQ.

# Privileged
This corresponds to the privilege account authentication which skips MFA.
MFA is actually skipped on server side.
On client side, a different login URL is used for the privileged account.
